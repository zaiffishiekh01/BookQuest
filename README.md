## Environment Variables

For security, do not share your actual `.env` file. Use this template:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key-here
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your-service-id-here
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your-template-id-here
```

## Hugging Face Spaces Integration

When deploying on Hugging Face Spaces, use their Secret Management for your environment variables:
1. Go to your Space settings
2. Add each variable from your `.env` file as a secret
3. Hugging Face Spaces will make these available to your app

## Troubleshooting

- **Email Not Sending**: Check your EmailJS credentials and template IDs
- **Book Data Not Loading**: Ensure you have internet access to fetch remote model files
- **Docker Issues**: Make sure Docker is installed and running
- **UI Problems**: Clear your browser cache or try a different browser
